# object-fetcher

This collects all civ entities and tries to convert them to the ss14 format.

Before this, you need to compile civ13 on openDream, or use the file in [here](https://github.com/Civ13/Civ13/blob/opendream/civ13.json), placing it in this folder.

Run `object-fetcher.js` using Node.JS. Run recipe-converter first!
